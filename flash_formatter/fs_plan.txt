==FLASH INFORMATION==
Total size - 1Gb = 125MB
Reads occur in chuncks of 2048 Bytes (So ideal page size is multiple of this)

==Overall File system information==
Offsets are always in pages
Page size: 2048 - Since 65535 * 2048 = 134MB > 125MB
Sizes are always in bytes (To avoid unecessary allocation in the pico)
Directories and files will be differentiated by extensions.
  Directories will use extension 0xFFFFFF
  Full Screen: 'FUL'
  Icons will:  'ICN'
  Characters:  'CHR'
  C Structs:   'DAT'

==TABLE ENTRY==
Address       (2 Bytes): Offset in pages
File Length   (4 Bytes): Length of the file in bytes.
File/Dir Name (10 Bytes): 7+3 (5 bytes for the name, 3 bytes for the extention)

The current directory should be the first file entry and should give the length.

==Files==
Anything that will be displayed on the screen will start with 32 bytes representing the height and the width of the image (16-bit width, 16-bit height)
