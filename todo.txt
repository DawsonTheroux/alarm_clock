I want to setup multicore freeRTOS:
It looks liek I can do that with info from these links:
- https://www.freertos.org/smp-demos-for-the-raspberry-pi-pico-board.html
- https://community.element14.com/products/raspberry-pi/b/blog/posts/raspberry-pico---play-with-multi-core-freertos-smp

TO do this I need to do:
1. copy the config file from the demo source.
2. Pull the external linker files to fix the linker errors.
  (This is outlined in the link.)

Pico pin allocation:
  4x for epaper SPI
  2x for COM to esp
  1x analog for battery monitor
  4x SD card
  2x EEPROM
  2x buttons
  1x buzzer
  2x UART to USB
